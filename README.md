## Project Overview

This project is about building a smart backpack carrier that follows on the right side where the user goes and is able to dodge the obstacles. 

## Educational Value Added

Robot Designing, communciation, controls, Embedded Systems

## Tasks

1. control motoers with motor drivers  by 2/10/2025

## Design Decisions

No more sore shoulders! Say goodbye to the strain of heavy backpacksâ€”let our smart carrier do the work while you move freely and effortlessly!
