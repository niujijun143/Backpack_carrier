## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a car that can be remotely controlled using hand gestures.

## ducational Value Added

- Robot Design

- Communication & Controls

- Embedded Systems

- CAD Design

- PCB Design

## Tasks

- Research components – Due 09/07/2025

- (More tasks to be added)

## Design Decisions

This prototype serves as an entry point into robotics. Two potential directions for future development are:

1. Using drone propellers instead of motors.

2. Applying computer vision on the motor system to automatically avoid obstacles.

## Design Misc
### Current Rubric

- Removable and rechargeable batteries providing at least 10 minutes of operation

- Ability to detect slight hand gestures and respond accordingly

### Future Developments

- Ability to climb stairs

- Mobile app remote control

- Distance warning bracelet

- Solar panel power integration
